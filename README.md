# fabs-first-wrangle

This was my very first wrangle function that I've done for a project. The objective of the project was to create a model that can predict the price of apartments in the city of Buenos Aires, with a focus on apartments that cost less than $400,000. The task was to write a write a wrangle function that takes a file path as an argument and returns a DataFrame.
